# ðŸ”  Letter Printer
#### I originally made a simplified version of this in Java for an intro to CS class in Uni. The program would print 3 letters. The code I wrote was meant to print as many letters as you inputted so I could make this version of it. I rewrote it in C# and I added letters A-Z, 1-9, space, and underscore. Very silly, and for some reason very satisfying.
